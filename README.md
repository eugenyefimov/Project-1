### Multi-Region Infrastructure Deployment with AWS

This project is dedicated to designing and implementing a highly available infrastructure across multiple AWS regions using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

## Architecture Overview

This solution creates a globally distributed application with:

- Frontend hosted on AWS
- Backend services deployed across multiple AWS regions
- Automated failover and load balancing
- CI/CD pipeline for continuous deployment

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Architecture Overview

This solution integrates Vercel for frontend deployment with AWS for backend services across multiple regions . The architecture provides:

- **Frontend**: Deployed on AWS's global edge network for low-latency content delivery
- **Backend**: Distributed across multiple AWS regions with automatic failover
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All resources defined in Terraform
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment through GitHub Actions


### 2. Key Components

#### Terraform Configuration

The Terraform configuration is organized into:

- **Main configuration**: Sets up providers and imports region modules
- **Region module**: Configures AWS resources in each region
- **Variables**: Customizable parameters for your deployment
- **Vercel integration**: Connects your frontend to the multi-region backend 


#### AWS Resources

For each region, the following is provisioned:

- VPC with public subnets across multiple availability zones
- Auto Scaling Group with EC2 instances
- Application Load Balancer (ELB)
- Security groups and routing tables


#### Route53 Global Load Balancing

Route53 provides global DNS-based load balancing with:

- Health checks to monitor regional availability
- Failover routing policy to automatically route traffic to healthy regions
- Low TTL values for quick failover response


#### AWS Integration

The Terraform AWS provider allows you to:

- Create and configure Vercel projects
- Set up environment variables
- Configure custom domains 


### 3. CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow automates:

- Terraform validation and formatting
- Infrastructure planning
- Deployment to AWS
- Proper environment variable handling


### 4. Security & Compliance

This architecture implements several security best practices:

- Isolated VPCs with proper security groups
- HTTPS for all public endpoints
- Secrets management through GitHub Secrets and environment variables
- Regional failover for high availability 


### 5. Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Configure your variables in terraform.tfvars
3. Set up GitHub Secrets for CI/CD
4. Push to your repository to trigger deployment
5. Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow


### Conclusion

This multi-region infrastructure provides a robust, scalable, and highly available architecture that leverages the best of both Vercel and AWS. By using Infrastructure as Code principles with Terraform, you can easily maintain, update, and replicate your infrastructure across environments.

The integration between Vercel's global edge network for frontend delivery and AWS's regional infrastructure for backend services creates a resilient application architecture with automatic failover capabilities
